            Life as such is challenging and the humans have made it more complicated because life has fallen into class and categories 
            where the rich are getting richer and the poor are dying for food. It is heart-wrenching to see this situation because people 
            are suffering from hunger, lack of education and also some are homeless.Undoubtedly, you can donate to some poor people on the
             street but that would not help because you need to make sure that money that goes as donation must be distributed properly.
              Hence, you should donate through an organization that specializes in helping the poor.

            Undoubtedly, there could be thousands of such organizations but you should be able to find the right and authentic organization
             so as to ensure that the money that goes for donation riches to the poor.

            Donating to charity is a major mood-booster. The knowledge that you’re helping others is hugely empowering and, 
            in turn, can make you feel happier and more fulfilled. Research has identified a link between making a donation
            to charity and increased activity in the area of the brain that registers pleasure – proving that as the old adage goes, 
            it really is far better to give than to receive.
            CAF's latest UK Giving report found that 20% of people surveyed said that they gave to charity because doing so made them feel good. In our research, 'Why we give', published back in 2014, we asked 700 of our generous donors to tell us what motivates them to give regularly to charity; 42% cited the enjoyment they receive from giving as a key influence.

            It is always better to give than to receive. When we help others, we not only make their lives better, but we also make the world
            a better place. Helping those in need not only benefits them, but it also benefits us. It feels good to know that we are making a
            difference in someone’s life. There are many ways that we can help those who are less fortunate than us. We can volunteer our time 
            at a local soup kitchen or food bank. We can donate clothes or food to a local shelter. We can also simply lend a listening ear to 
            someone who needs someone to talk to. We can help the poor, by providing things such as by giving them money, food, clothes, or 
            shelter. Whatever way we choose to help, we should do so with a loving heart. We should also try to help them in other ways, such as 
            by providing them with education or job opportunities. By helping the poor, we not only improve their lives but also make the world 
            a better place.
